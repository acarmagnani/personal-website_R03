                        <b1>What is the future of our cities? How can we deal with their unused spaces? Or better yet, how can we better utilize urban spaces? Should we limit ourselves only to the building envelope to express ourselves? These are questions that I aim to discuss in this study. The more I analyze São Paulo and its unrestrained real estate development, the more I worry about the direction the city is taking. Increasingly impersonal and impermeable, I wonder if a better alternative wouldn't be to look at the São Paulo metropolis from its voids instead of its fullness.</b1>

This is because the facilities positioned above the buildings need to eventually reach the ground level, ensuring vertical circulation within the project and providing structural support.</b1>

Thus, the vertical structures of the project would act like the trunks of a tree, branching out into a broad canopy beyond the elevation of the buildings that contain the void. In addition to serving as a location for structural support, the internal voids of the blocks could also be considered as potential areas for public enjoyment — internal courtyards accessible to the public. This would allow the insertion of facilities in these areas and act as incentives for ascending the structures proposed in the project.</b1>

                        <b1>The project has been divided into two potential design approaches. The first involves creating metal structures that extend to the ground through existing voids within the interiors of the buildings in the city block. These more disruptive structures constitute the initial interaction from the block's ground level to the volumes in the upper voids of the block. The set of pillars and beams, resembling a crane, measuring 240cm by 240cm, ensures a strong foundation and a potential passage for elevators. It's essential to note that there is a connection between the three volumes created by beams, also with a section of 240cm by 240cm, allowing the passage of a person through the center. Thus, we can affirm that the structural elements of the project also act as circulatory components.</b1>
