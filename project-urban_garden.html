                        <b1>Based on research, this project aims to create a network of interconnected initiatives in the Bixiga neighborhood. The facilities developed by the team aim to subtly interact with the local population while having effective impacts on the daily lives of individuals, ultimately creating a more enjoyable, contemplative, and sustainable urban experience.</b1>

                        <b1>Despite the presence of a significant number of food and consumption centers in the Bixiga neighborhood, issues of hunger and difficulties in obtaining food and knowledge about it cannot be overlooked. Therefore, the focus of the group to which this project belongs is on addressing hunger and integrating individuals into a setting that involves the creation and generation of food. This project involves the creation of an urban garden that utilizes blind facades of the city for cultivation spaces, a center with workshops, laboratories, and commerce, a water body for fish farming and soil infiltration, and a public space that interacts with the city and other team projects. Additionally, the group has projects for a food center and a center for various equipment.</b1>

                        <b1>The main building of this project is located underground, aiming to be invisible and permeable. Due to the pronounced topography of the terrain, part of the project goes beneath the ground and emerges on the surface on the other side of the lot, turning its roof into an open park for the public. The building includes workshops, classrooms, technical rooms, bathrooms, a restaurant, and various openings for natural light and ventilation. Finally, the gardens themselves are fixed using metal structures on the blind facades of neighboring buildings.</b1>
