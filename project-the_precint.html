                        <b1>This project emerged with the premise of creating an equitable, permeable, and contemplative environment, with meditation being the main activity facilitated. To achieve this, various aspects of the project were approached from different angles to execute a space with a smooth flow of people, pleasant ventilation and sunlight, a modern aesthetic, and a viable structure while embracing the project's theme.</b1>

                        <b1>The global instability brought about by the advancement of COVID-19 and its consequences underscores the need for a space suitable for daily meditation. Thus, considering the fact that meditation has scientific support linking the practice to reduced anxiety, stress, and various other issues related to mental and physical health, investing in this type of contemplative practice is crucial.</b1>

                        <b1>With the idea that the space should promote meditation and contemplation, it was decided to design partially open modules throughout the site to ensure a certain level of privacy and intimacy for individuals. To achieve this, curved walls were created both vertically and horizontally, providing a sense of comfort. Furthermore, due to differences in heights and thicknesses of the walls, the amount of water present, and the types and densities of vegetation, the further into the site one goes, the more intimate the environment becomes.</b1>
